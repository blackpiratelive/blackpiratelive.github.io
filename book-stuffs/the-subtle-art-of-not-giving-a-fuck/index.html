<!--All the highlights will go between <li> tag.-->
    <li class='para'>See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in Bukowski's work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself-especially the worst parts of himself-and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Fame and success didn't make him a better person. Nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.

    <br>
    <li class='para'>The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it's giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important.
(Location 95)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>It's this last part that gets us into trouble. We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me?
(Location 123)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.
(Location 139)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>"the backwards law"-the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.
(Location 143)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make.
(Location 144)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance.
(Location 145)</li>
    <br>
        <li class='para'>The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you.
(Location 146)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>"You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life." Or put more simply: Don't try.
(Location 151)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>What's interesting about the backwards law is that it's called "backwards" for a reason: not giving a fuck works in reverse. If pursuing the positive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what's necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.
(Location 159)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.
(Location 166)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life...
(Location 168)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>While not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it's a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don't even know what that sentence means, but I don't give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let's just go with it.
(Location 179)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>You're going to die one day. I know that's kind of obvious, but I just wanted to remind you in case you'd forgotten. You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice-well, then you're going to get fucked.
(Location 186)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>There's a name for a person who finds no emotion or meaning in anything: a psychopath. Why you would want to emulate a psychopath, I have no fucking clue.
(Location 201)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Let's be clear. There's absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They're couch potatoes and Internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or combing it. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so they hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They're afraid to let anyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique snowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand.
(Location 205)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>They say, "Fuck it," not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose. Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter, people give a fuck about them in return.
(Location 227)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>You can't be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.
(Location 231)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you-your ex-boyfriend's new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer-chances are you don't have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And that's your real problem. Not the hand sanitizer. Not the TV remote.
(Location 246)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>...we become more selective about the fucks we're willing to give. This is something called maturity. It's nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what's truly fuckworthy.
(Location 262)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we're never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston's tits. And that's okay. Life goes on.
(Location 268)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of shit, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of low-level spiritual way. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.
(Location 285)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>...greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue, our own psychological Atlantis.
(Location 288)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>...that life itself is a form of suffering. The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention.
(Location 326)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>"What you consider 'friendship' is really just your constant attempts to impress people."
(Location 344)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>So no-our own pain and misery aren't a bug of human evolution; they're a feature.
(Location 355)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Warren Buffett's got money problems; the drunk hobo down at Kwik-E Mart's got money problems. Buffett's just got better money problems than the hobo. All of life is like this.
(Location 379)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The secret sauce is in the solving of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place.
(Location 394)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>1. Denial. Some people deny that their problems exist in the first place. And because they deny reality, they must constantly delude or distract themselves from reality. This may make them feel good in the short term, but it leads to a life of insecurity, neuroticism, and emotional repression. 2. Victim Mentality. Some choose to believe that there is nothing they can do to solve their problems, even when they in fact could. Victims seek to blame others for their problems or blame outside circumstances. This may make them feel better in the short term, but it leads to a life of anger, helplessness, and despair. People deny and blame others for their problems for the simple reason that it's easy and feels good, while solving problems is hard and often feels bad. Forms of blame and denial give us a quick high. They are a way to temporarily escape our problems, and that escape can provide us a quick rush that makes us feel better.
(Location 405)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he's happy.
(Location 416)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to do something.
(Location 428)</li>

    <br>

    <li class='para'>Emotions are part of the equation of our lives, but not the entire equation. Just because something feels good doesn't mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn't mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments. Therefore, we shouldn't always trust our own emotions. In fact, I believe we should make a habit of questioning them.
(Location 431)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Decision-making based on emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, pretty much always sucks. You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids. And dogs. You know what else three-year-olds and dogs do? Shit on the carpet.
(Location 439)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow...
(Location 442)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice-whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad. What we gain is also what we lose. What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences.
(Location 447)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Most people want to have great sex and an awesome relationship, but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings, and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder, "What if?" for years and years, until the question morphs from "What if?" into "What else?" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail, they say, "What for?" If not for their lowered standards and expectations twenty years prior, then what for?
(Location 462)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>People want to start their own business. But you don't end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, the insane hours devoted to something that may earn absolutely nothing.
(Location 473)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>You can't win if you don't play.
(Location 477)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>I was in love with the result-the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I was playing-but I wasn't in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly.
(Location 491)</li>
    <br>
<li class='para'>And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn't like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.
(Location 495)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The truth is, I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn't. End of story. I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn't work that way.
(Location 499)</li>

(Location 499)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.
(Location 501)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>And if you think at any point you're allowed to stop climbing, I'm afraid you're missing the point. Because the joy is in the climb itself.
(Location 507)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>...the solutions to today's problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow's problems, and so on.
(Location 628)</li>
    <br>

(Location 645)</li>
    <li class='para'>We all have our chosen methods to numb the pain of our problems, and in moderate doses there is nothing wrong with this. But the longer we avoid and the longer we numb, the more painful it will be when we finally do confront our issues.
(Location 648)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>And like all parents, my parents, with the best of intentions, imparted some of their problems to me, as I probably will to my kids.
(Location 657)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>It wasn't so much the sex I craved, although the sex was fun. It was the validation. I was wanted; I was loved; for the first time since I could remember, I was worthy. My craving for validation quickly fed into a mental habit of self-aggrandizing and overindulgence. I felt entitled to say or do whatever I wanted, to break people's trust, to ignore people's feelings, and then justify it later with shitty, half-assed apologies.
(Location 669)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The truth is that there's no such thing as a personal problem. If you've got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future.
(Location 686)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Often, it's this realization-that you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or pain-that is the first and most important step toward solving them.
(Location 690)</li>
    <br>
<li class='para'>Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you're exceptional at one thing, chances are you're average or below average at most other things. That's just the nature of life. To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate shit-tons of time and energy to it. And because we all have limited time and energy, few of us ever become truly exceptional at more than one thing, if anything at all.
(Location 705)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>We can then say that it's a statistical improbability that any single person will be an extraordinary performer in all areas of life, or even in many areas of their life. Brilliant businesspeople are often fuckups in their personal lives. Extraordinary athletes are often shallow and as dumb as a lobotomized rock. Many celebrities are probably just as clueless about life as the people who gawk at them and follow their every move.
(Location 708)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. And because we're all quite average most of the time, the deluge of exceptional information drives us to feel pretty damn insecure and desperate, because clearly we are somehow not good enough. So more and more we feel the need to compensate through entitlement and addiction. We cope the only way we know how: either through self-aggrandizing or through other-aggrandizing. Some of us do this by cooking up get-rich-quick schemes. Others do it by taking off across the world to save starving babies in Africa. Others do it by excelling in school and winning every award. Others do it by shooting up a school. Others do it by trying to have sex with anything that talks and breathes.
(Location 720)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame.
(Location 737)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>It has become an accepted part of our culture today to believe that we are all destined to do something truly extraordinary. Celebrities say it. Business tycoons say it. Politicians say it. Even Oprah says it (so it must be true). Each and every one of us can be extraordinary. We all deserve greatness. The fact that this statement is inherently contradictory-after all, if everyone were extraordinary, then by definition no one would be extraordinary-is missed by most people. And instead of questioning what we actually deserve or don't deserve, we eat the message up and ask for more. Being "average" has become the new standard of failure. The worst thing you can be is in the middle of the pack, the middle of the bell curve. When a culture's standard of success is to "be extraordinary," it then becomes better to be at the extreme low end of the bell curve than to be in the middle, because at least there you're still special and deserve attention. Many people choose this strategy: to prove to everyone that they are the most miserable, or the most oppressed, or the most victimized.
(Location 740)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they're exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they're obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It's anti-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they're not already great-they are mediocre, they are average-and that they could be so much better.
(Location 753)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>All of this "every person can be extraordinary and achieve greatness" stuff is basically just jerking off your ego.

    <li class='para'>"The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that's okay."
(Location 761)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>You will have a growing appreciation for life's basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about.
(Location 766)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Humans often choose to dedicate large portions of their lives to seemingly useless or destructive causes.
(Location 828)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>If suffering is inevitable, if our problems in life are unavoidable, then the question we should be asking is not "How do I stop suffering?" but "Why am I suffering-for what purpose?"
(Location 837)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it, and the more you peel them back, the more likely you're going to start crying at inappropriate times.
(Location 852)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>...because our values determine the nature of our problems, and the nature of our problems determines the quality of our lives.
(Location 876)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>But when they ask themselves why they feel lonely, they tend to come up with a way to blame others-everyone else is mean, or no one is cool or smart enough to understand them-and thus they further avoid their problem instead of seeking to solve it.
(Location 882)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Well, perhaps I don't need to be close to my brother to have that good relationship that I value. Perhaps there just needs to be some mutual respect (which there is). Or maybe mutual trust is what to look for (and it's there). Perhaps these metrics would be better assessments of brotherhood than how many text messages he and I exchange.
(Location 1167)</li>
    <br>
    
    <li class='para'>Problems may be inevitable, but the meaning of each problem is not. We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them.
(Location 924)</li>
<br>
    <li class='para'>Pleasure is a false god. Research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose.
(Location 1250)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Pleasure is not the cause of happiness; rather, it is the effect. If you get the other stuff right (the other values and metrics), then pleasure will naturally occur as a by-product.
(Location 1255)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs (food, shelter, and so on), the correlation between happiness and worldly success quickly approaches zero. So if you're starving and living on the street in the middle of India, an extra ten thousand dollars a year would affect your happiness a lot. But if you're sitting pretty in the middle class in a developed country, an extra ten thousand dollars per year won't affect anything much-meaning that you're killing yourself working overtime and weekends for basically nothing.
(Location 1259)</li>
    
    <br>
    <li class='para'>We're apes. We think we're all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we're just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves?
(Location 946)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbols they're able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they're probably assholes as well.
(Location 1264)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The fact is, people who base their self-worth on being right about everything prevent themselves from learning from their mistakes. They lack the ability to take on new perspectives and empathize with others. They close themselves off to new and important information.
(Location 1269)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>While there is something to be said for "staying on the sunny side of life," the truth is, sometimes life sucks, and the healthiest thing you can do is admit it.
(Location 1276)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Denying negative emotions leads to experiencing deeper and more prolonged negative emotions and to emotional dysfunction. Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a valid solution to life's problems-problems which, by the way, if you're choosing the right values and metrics, should be invigorating you and motivating you.
(Location 1278)</li>
    <br>
      <li class='para'>When we force ourselves to stay positive at all times, we deny the existence of our life's problems. And when we deny our problems, we rob ourselves of the chance to solve them and generate happiness. Problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life. Thus to duck our problems is to lead a meaningless (even if supposedly pleasant) existence.
(Location 1288)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>This is why these values-pleasure, material success, always being right, staying positive-are poor ideals for a person's life. Some of the greatest moments of one's life are not pleasant, not successful, not known, and not positive.
(Location 1296)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)
(Location 1308)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Some examples of bad, unhealthy values: dominance through manipulation or violence, indiscriminate fucking, feeling good all the time, always being the center of attention, not being alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich, sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.
(Location 1311)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Values are about prioritization. Everybody would love a good cannoli or a house in the Bahamas. The question is your priorities. What are the values that you prioritize above everything else, and that therefore influence your decision-making more than anything else?
(Location 1319)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it.
(Location 1360)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>If you're miserable in your current situation, chances are it's because you feel like some part of it is outside your control-that there's a problem you have no ability to solve, a problem that was somehow thrust upon you without your choosing.
(Location 1362)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>When we feel that we're choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.
(Location 1364)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>There is a simple realization from which all personal improvement and growth emerges. This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances.
(Location 1402)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The point is, we are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always.
(Location 1413)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>It comes back to how, in reality, there is no such thing as not giving a single fuck. It's impossible. We must all give a fuck about something. To not give a fuck about anything is still to give a fuck about something.
(Location 1414)</li>
    <br>
    <li class='para'>The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives. Accepting responsibility for our problems is thus the first step to solving them.
(Location 1431)</li>
<br>
    <li class='para'>Here's one way to think about the distinction between the two concepts. Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you're currently making, every second of every day. You are choosing to read this. You are choosing to think about the concepts. You are choosing to accept or reject the concepts. It may be my fault that you think my ideas are lame, but you are responsible for coming to your own conclusions. It's not your fault that I chose to write this sentence, but you are still responsible for choosing to read it (or not).

    <li class='para'>I learned the hard way that if the people in your relationships are selfish and doing hurtful things, it's likely you are too, you just don't realize it.

People who consistently make the best choices in the situations they're given are the ones who eventually come out ahead in poker, just as in life.

And because you and I and everybody else all have differing needs and personal histories and life circumstances, we will all inevitably come to differing "correct" answers about what our lives mean and how they should be lived. My correct answer involves traveling alone for years on end, living in obscure places, and laughing at my own farts. Or at least that was the correct answer up until recently. That answer will change and evolve, because I change and evolve; and as I grow older and more experienced, I chip away at how wrong I am, becoming less and less wrong every day.

That man doesn't ask for the promotion because he would have to confront his beliefs about what his skills are actually worth.

With time, I learned how the whole system worked. And because I knew how it all worked, I was often the only person in the house who used the stuff. As is the case for many millennial children, my parents looked on as if I were some sort of prodigy. To them, the fact that I could program the VCR without looking at the instruction manual made me the Second Coming of Tesla. It's easy to look back at my parents' generation and chuckle at their technophobia. But the further I get into adulthood, the more I realize that we all have areas of our lives where we're like my parents with the new VCR: we sit and stare and shake our heads and say, "But how?"

Asking someone to move out of your house is a clear decision; feeling as if you're abandoning your own children is not. I struggled with social anxiety throughout much of my adolescence and young adult life. I spent most of my days distracting myself with video games and most of my nights either drinking or smoking away my uneasiness. For many years, the thought of speaking to a stranger-especially if that stranger happened to be particularly attractive/interesting/popular/smart-felt impossible to me. I walked around in a daze for years, asking myself dumb VCR questions: "How? How do you just walk up and talk to a person? How can somebody do that?" I had all sorts of screwed-up beliefs about this, like that you weren't allowed to speak to someone unless you had some practical reason to, or that women would think I was a creepy rapist if I so much as said, "Hello." The problem was that my emotions defined my reality. Because it felt like people didn't want to talk to me, I came to believe that people didn't want to talk to me. And thus, my VCR question: "How do you just walk up and talk to a person?" Because I failed to separate what I felt from what was, I was incapable of stepping outside myself and seeing the world for what it was: a simple place where two people can walk up to each other at any time and speak.

Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would.

This feeling is what people go to church for; it's what they fight in wars for; it's what they raise families and save pensions and build bridges and invent cell phones for: this fleeting sense of being part of something greater and more unknowable than themselves.

    <li class='para'>The pampering of the modern mind has resulted in a population that feels deserving of something without earning that something, a population that feels they have a right to something without sacrificing for it. People declare themselves experts, entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, mavericks, and coaches without any real-life experience. And they do this not because they actually think they are greater than everybody else; they do it because they feel that they need to be great to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary.
