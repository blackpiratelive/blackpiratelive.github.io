<p class="blog-heading">Why I Love WM</p>
<p class="date blog-date">Date: March 30, 2022</p>
<br>
<p>
    WM stands for window manager. It is a alternative to using full blown desktop environment. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/window_manager">More info on ArchWiki.</a>
    <br>
    I have recently started using WM, first i3 now on bspwm. And absolutely love it.
    <br>
    If you are someone who is used to use normal desktop environment like gnome, kde, xfce or any other <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment">DE (Desktop Environment)</a>, I’d suggest to try out WM.You can start with anyone of those window manager you’re comfortable with. Setting up wm is easy on fresh arch install so it shouldn’t be a barrier.
</p>
<h2>You can do everything using keyboard shortcuts.</h2>
<p>Opening windows, closing windows, moving to different workspaces etc, can be done using keyboard shortcuts. It took me few days to get used to use keyboard shortcuts but now i can say it’s miles better than using mouse.</p>
<h2>One window doesn’t cover another</h2>
<p>Yes it doesn’t (by default), and why the hell would you want to keep one window on top of another?</p>
<h2>Easily customizable</h2>
<p>I open up documentation in one workspace and vim with config file opened in another workspace. Changing everything is as easy as editing a text file. Documentations are mostly gets the job done, but if still doesn’t work one quick brave Search or youtube search does it.</p>
<h2>Loading other’s configuration</h2>
<p>Sometimes I don’t wanna configure everything by myself, so I’d go <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> and load other’s configuration. And voilà its done. Well in reality I still have to open the config file and tweak here and there, but it’s usually ’less time consuming'.</p>
<h2>Forces you to use the terminal</h2>
<p>I’m a pretty new when it comes to Linux. Although terminal doesn’t scare me anymore, I sometimes still think using terminal is hard. Using a wm forces me to use terminal when possible.</p>
<h2>Texts >>> Icons</h2>
<p>I have never been a fan of icons, I’d prefer simple texts over icons any day. A window manager normally doesn’t have icons.</p>
<h2>Its minimal, less distracting, more productive</h2>
<p>I don’t spend any time trying to arrange my opened tabs. (Suck on that Windows users) I’d open a programme because I want to open it, not because I was sitting mindlessly and getting bored.</p>
<h2>Elitism Feeling</h2>
<p>It comes with the OS, if you’re a Linux user you know what I’m taking about.</p>
<br>
<p class="blog-heading">In Conclusion:</p>
<p>If you are still not convinced, I’ll suggest you give it a try, take a break from conventional way of managing windows and embrace the new. You can always go back to doing things your way.</p>
<p><b>PS: I use Arch BTW</b></p>
