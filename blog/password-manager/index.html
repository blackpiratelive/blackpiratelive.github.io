<h2>Password Manager Review</h2>
<p class="date">Date: Nov 9, 2021</p>

<p>
    Throughout the years i have used many password managers. One of the biggest reasons I started using a password manager is not because of the security but rather I wanted a quick way to type my passwords. Also its easy for me to loose track of the websites I have signed up for. Now you may ask why I didn't use something like password manager built in most modern web browser? Well the answer to that question is I wanted a cross compatibility to different browsers, and anybody who's using computers for enough time knows that its not possible to sync your passwords to Firefox from chrome or other way around. Keep in mind that I am not talking about import or export, I want them to sync. 

</p>
<h3>How I got started</h3>

<p>
    Since I was a student and my parents didn't give any kind of pocket money to spend, I was looking for free password managers. And so I started using LastPass.  LastPass was actually good that time, I'm talking about around 2016-17. Slowly I started experimenting with different password managers. And now after four years of using most popular password managers I am here to share my opinions.

<p>
    Before starting I want to clear some things first. This review is based on my overall experience. I have only android devices and windows. Your mileage may vary if you are in apple ecosystem. If you dont agree with me feel free to <a href ="../../contact/">send me an email</a>

<ol class="align-left">
    <li class="align-left">LastPass</li>
        <ul class="align-left">
            <li class="align-left">Pros:</li>
                <ol class="align-left">
                    <li class="align-left">There is seriously none. Period. Only reason to use it would be you're into their ecosystem and can't get out, or you have to use it for work.</li>
                </ol>
            <li class="align-left">Cons:</li>
                <ol class="align-left">
                    <li class="align-left">Android app is terrible. The UI looks outdated. Android app is filled with trackers.</li>
                    <li class="align-left">Has very serious security flaws throughout the years. <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass#Security_issues">More info</a></li>
                    <li class="align-left">Free version is unusable.</li>
        
                    <li class="align-left">You cannot export your 2fa seeds if you ever plan to move to a new password manager. (Its necessary feature to have if you are planning to future proof your passwords or 2fa seeds.)</li>
                </ol>
        </ul>
        <li class="align-left">Bitwarden</li>
            <ul class="align-left">
            <li class="align-left">Pros: There is lot to love in Bitwarden.</li>
                <ol class="align-left">
                    <li class="align-left">Security is flawless. Their apps are open source, You can self host your own instance if you want to.</li>
                    <li class="align-left">Privacy is also flawless. Android apps don't contain any kind of trackers.</li>
                    <li class="align-left">Has wide range of supported devices.</li>
                    <li class="align-left">There's no trackers in android apps and windows apps.</li>
                </ol>
            <li class="align-left">Cons: These might sound like nitpicking.</li>
                <ol class="align-left">
                    <li class="align-left">I can't like the android app ui. It doesn't feel modern. It isn't laggy but feels sluggish. </li>
                    <li class="align-left">Their premium version is only 10$ per year, yes its hella cheap, but not in 3rd world countries. I wish they did regional pricing (I would definitely pay for it.)</a></li>
                    <li class="align-left">I'd love to have an option where I can upload the encrypted data to a cloud drive. Its like self hosting only the data. (1password and enpass can do this.)</li>
                    

                </ol>
        </ul>
        <li class="align-left">1password</li>
        <ul class="align-left">
            <li class="align-left">Pros:</li>
                <ol class="align-left">
                    <li class="align-left">If you're willing to pay for a password manager this can be a great choice. </li>
                    <li class="align-left">Absolutely a lot of features that you might find useful. For example password history, ability to add any custom field and section to store different types of information.</li>
                    <li class="align-left">You can choose to store all the encrypted data to your own choice of cloud storage, like dropbox or google drive.</li>
                    <li class="align-left">There's no trackers in android apps and windows apps.</li>
                </ol>
            <li class="align-left">Cons:</li>
                <ol class="align-left">
                    <li class="align-left">You cannot upload documents if you choose to store passwords by yourself (kinda like self hosting but not really) I mean one of the main reason to self host is that you can get document storage as much as you need. Even dropbox free gives 2GB (which can be increased to 18GB) which is much better than 1GB storage that you get in your subscription. </li>
                    <li class="align-left">It is not open source at all. But they didn't have any data breach or anything that I can find out. 
                    <li class="align-left">I'd love to have an option where I can upload the encrypted data to a cloud drive. Its like self hosting only the data. (1password and enpass can do this.)</li>
