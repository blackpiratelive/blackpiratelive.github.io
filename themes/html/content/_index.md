# Hey there! I'm Sudip.
 Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet.
I made this page to store things I like, free from algorithms.
I'm in my early twenties, finished Zoology graduation in 2025, now preparing for govt job exams.
  Building websites is my hobby. I love ducks and cats.

## About Me
Who am I? Almost extroverted, but definitely like solitude. I spend a lot of time working with tech stuff but I also study, and sometimes when I have a chance I travel.
Good balance I guess?

## Currently 
 Preparing for exams. Graduate in Zoology from Bankura Christian College. Now living in Midnapore.

## My Projects
- Diary (https://diary.sudipx.in)

## My Interests
- Computers: I love computers, due to some personal reasons I was not able to study it in college, but I still love it to this day. 
- **Travelling**: I do not do this often. But in future when I have the opportunity I would. 
- **Photography**: I used to do this a lot during my college years.
