    the solutions to today's problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow's problems, and so on.</p>
<hr>

    <p> Forms of blame and denial give us a quick high. They are a way to temporarily escape our problems, and that escape can provide us a quick rush that makes us feel better. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he's happy.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>We all have our chosen methods to numb the pain of our problems, and in moderate doses there is nothing wrong with this. But the longer we avoid and the longer we numb, the more painful it will be when we finally do confront our issues.</p>

    <br>
    <p>In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it's because you're supposed to do something.</p>

    <hr>
    <p> Decision-making based on emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, pretty much always sucks. You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids. And dogs. You know what else three-year-olds and dogs do? Shit on the carpet.</p>
    <hr>

    <p> Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>A fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a never-ending pursuit of "something else"-a new house, a new relationship, another child, another pay raise. And despite all of our sweat and strain, we end up feeling eerily similar to how we started: inadequate.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>A more interesting question, a question that most people never consider, is, "What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?" Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>They settle and wonder, "What if?" for years and years, until the question morphs from "What if?" into "What else?" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail, they say, "What for?" If not for their lowered standards and expectations twenty years prior, then what for?</p>

    <hr>
    <p> People want to start their own business. But you don't end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, the insane hours devoted to something that may earn absolutely nothing.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>What determines your success isn't, "What do you want to enjoy?" The relevant question is, "What pain do you want to sustain?" The path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn't like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>The truth is, I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn't. End of story.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.</p>
