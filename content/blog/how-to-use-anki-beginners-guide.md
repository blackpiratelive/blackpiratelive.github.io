Anki looks scary at first, but you only need a few basics to start learning fast. This guide keeps it simple and practical so you can make your first deck, review daily, and actually stick with it.

## 1. Install Anki and sync

Download Anki for desktop first (Windows/Mac/Linux). The desktop app is where you create and edit cards. Then create a free AnkiWeb account so your cards sync across devices. The mobile apps are optional, but very useful for reviews.

## 2. Learn the three main ideas

Before you make cards, understand these three words:

- **Deck**: a folder that holds cards (example: "Biology" or "Vocabulary").
- **Note**: the information you type (front/back, or cloze fields).
- **Card**: what you actually review. One note can create multiple cards.

If you add one note with a front and a back, Anki makes one card. If you use a cloze note, one note can make several cards.

## 3. Create your first deck

1. Open Anki desktop.
2. Click **Create Deck**, name it (example: "Anki Basics").
3. Click **Add** and choose the default note type "Basic".
4. Type a simple question and answer.
5. Click **Add** again to save.

That’s it. You now have a deck and at least one card.

## 4. Make good cards (simple rules)

Bad cards feel heavy and boring. Good cards feel quick and clear.

- Keep **one fact per card**. If a card feels long, split it.
- Use **short questions** and **short answers**.
- Add **context only when needed**.
- Prefer **recall** over recognition. Ask “What is X?” instead of “Is X true?”

Example:

- Bad: "Explain everything about mitochondria."
- Good: "What is the main function of mitochondria?"

## 5. Use cloze deletions for lists

Lists are painful if you use only basic cards. Cloze notes are better.

Example cloze:

`The capital of France is {{c1::Paris}}.`

Anki will hide the word "Paris" and turn it into a card.

## 6. Keep reviews small but daily

Anki only works if you review. Start small and stay consistent.

- New cards per day: **10–20** is enough.
- Review every day. Missing a day adds stress.
- If reviews pile up, reduce new cards for a few days.

## 7. Tags and images

Use tags to group your cards by topic or chapter. Images are great for visual memory. Just don’t overload your cards with too much text or too many screenshots.

If you add images, keep the question simple and let the picture do the work.

## 8. Sync and backup

Press the **Sync** button often. The sync is your backup and keeps all devices updated. If you do a big import or edit, sync right after.

## 9. Common beginner mistakes

- Making huge cards that are hard to answer.
- Adding too many new cards too fast.
- Skipping reviews for “just a day.”
- Downloading massive shared decks instead of building your own.

Anki works best when you create cards from your own notes and textbooks.

## 10. Try a flashcard (interactive)

Here is a sample flashcard using a custom shortcode:

{{< flashcard front="What does spaced repetition help you do?" back="Remember information longer with fewer reviews." >}}

## Final tip

Anki is a habit tool, not magic. Keep your cards short, review daily, and your memory will slowly build up. Start small, stay consistent, and you will see results within a few weeks.
