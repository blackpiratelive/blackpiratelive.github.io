I recently discovered qute browser from a youtube channel, Bread with Penguins and oh my god it is so good. I have been watching her youtube videos lately and thats how I came to know about qute browser. She does these best or lesser known linux apps videos, and I love it. 
The browser is very minimal and the default keybindings are of vimkeys so they are very much easy to use. I love it. It has adblocker and althought it is not as good as uBlock Origin, it is plenty good for normal web browsing. Also I can just set up DNS for my whole laptop and block ads through that.
