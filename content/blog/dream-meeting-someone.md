I went to see something by my college road. But in the way we met a weird person. It looked like a mentally unstable person. We were teasing him. He started following us. Then halfway through the journey, there was a shop type 2 story building. He quickly changed and transformed into a girl. Yep, he was trans.
He kept following us. Now we are in the bhamuria Road, but I am actually going to the sammilani college. I was supposed to drop off at bhamuria more but i did not.

After crossing my mom's school, i thought enough is enough and decided to get off from the toto. I had two- 3 friends with me. But they were scared. I was scared too but didn't show it.
I approached the person, who is now a girl. He tried to make some magic, like eleven in stranger things style. But nothing happened. I confronted her. She said shes like this because of animal cruelty. She showed me a document of all the animal cruelty happened. It had also the recent dogs judgement by SC. But there was something odd at the bottom. A script. I read it and knew instantly what it does. I confronted her again, what does this script do? It look little bit of pressure for her to talk. She had that devilish smile. That little script changes any text you type to "I agree with everything". So it was a cult. I said.
But me being me, I do not know what happened, and I started flirting. Called her madam and what not. Then she left and we resumed our journey.
We took another toto and bargained. I was supposed to drop at my school and my other friends would go to their house. When I was crossing my school I was screaming that drop me off here, but he did not. Ultimately I was dropped off near a friend's house. When i went to pay 15 rs there was not enough change. One odd thing that i noticed was new coins, mostly in odd numbers 17, 19 rupee coins, these dont exist. There was 20rs coin also, I once saw it in real life and touched it. But someone else have it, not me. I have no idea how I had those coins in my wallet. I paid 50rs and told my friends, so they pay the difference. I entered, because its rude not to enter after coming that close and not go in. I ate some snacks there and she was there. But we didnt talk and she did not acknowledge me.

I came out took a toto to go to my home.
