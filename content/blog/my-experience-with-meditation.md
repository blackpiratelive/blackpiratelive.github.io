The motivation for meditation did not come from a book or a youtube video, it came from within me, my desire to get rid of those dreams I was getting so much. Earlier I would get those vivid dreams sometimes and they would be lucid sometimes, but after I left home and started living on my own, they started to become very frequent. I do not think I am less happy now that I am out of my house, but it definitely triggered something. I do not know exactly when this started but it did after I left home and came to Bankura. Enough self diagnosing, lets talk about what's relevant. 

### Why
I tried many thing to get rid of my dreams, changing diets, fixing sleep schdule and other parts of my lifestyle. I have a basic idea of things that are associated with these dreams, and it was coffee (there is another thing also, but due to privacy reasons I am not going to mention it here). I searched on the web for it and sure there were some reports of it. But the worrying thing is I would also get dreams when I did not drink coffee. It was more frequent if I drank coffee. When I fell asleep while listening to music then the dream might not come. I was desperate to find a better solution. 

### How
That is when I was watching classes from parmar sir, (parmar ssc youtube channel). There he would often talk about meditation and taking deep breath. I wanted to try it. My problem was not a physical one but something to do with my brain, I had to try it. I also heard about meditation from senior people around me and how I should do it before studying to better remember stuff. But it is awkward to do.

### Results
I know I had to do it for at least a week or so before I can see any results. I persisted and yes it worked. I was ecstated. That time I was doing it for almost everyday. Although I did not track the amount of time I was meditating it was in the ballpark of 5-10 minutes. Now my dreams are almost completely gone, I do get it sometimes if I do not meditate for  a long time, but the intensity and frequency of the dream has significantly reduced. I am continuing this habit. i have to be alone in a room when I do this otherwise I wont be able to concentrate. It is also awkward to do in front of other people as meditation is not very common among people. 

### Tips
If you are at the end of this post and still reading this, I have a suggestion for you. Give it a shot. It does not take much time only like 5-10 minutes and it will improve your mental health. I am not going to say it is panacea, but I get it now why leaders like Nehru used to practice meditation. Here is some of my tips in no particular order  if you are a beginner. 

- It is okay to feel awkward, everyone feels it. 
- Do not fight with your own thoughts, rather than think of it and slowly let is pass. There will be time when you wont be aware that you are thinking something else, but when you become aware shrug it off. 
- Focus on your breathing, take deep breaths. ( you can watch youtube videos for guidence)
- Continue this habit for at least 7 days. 
- Make sure to notice the state of mind you are in after 7 days, if you do not notice the change you are never going to continue. 
- Do not listen to music or anything, if you cannot get complete silence put on white noises and headphones. After a while you will feel silence. 
- Do not make excuses for not doing.
