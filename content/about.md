Hey, stranger on the internet. Hope you're doing well. I'm Sudip. This is a personal place for me on the internet. This is a also a place for me to experiment all the new things I learn about web developmet.

I am currently studying zoology. Making website is one of my hobbies. And I love ducks and cats.
Here is a cute duck for you to enjoy!
