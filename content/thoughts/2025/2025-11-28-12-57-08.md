Huge improvements to my Journal app. 
- Graph page is much more prettier, new graph, word heatmap.
- New map page that shows entries by location.
- Backend changes, no more localstorage, it now stores in a local db. (No storage limits)
- images are no longer heavily compressed, just lossess compression.
- Export is now Zip, images are exported as binary
- New more page, with a sleep analysis page, fetches sleep data and displays on editor.
