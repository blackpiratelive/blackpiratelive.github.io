I have so many plans to add to my books website. Writing it down here so i dont forget.
1. Proper login a public ui and logged in ui.
2. Show books that read on one day, one month and one week.
3. Ability to showcase certain quotes from a book at top of the ui.
4. Automatic export to a github repo.

Thanks it. Good night.
