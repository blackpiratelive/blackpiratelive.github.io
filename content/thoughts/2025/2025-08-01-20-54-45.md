Ideas that i may wanna implement.

- Timeline or Calendar View: - 
Generate a calendar heatmap showing volume of posts per day/month (e.g. GitHub‑style activity grid) or a vertical timeline view for easier browsing.
- Search or Filterable UI:- 
Install client-side search (like Algolia/Tipue or simple Lunr.js) to allow users to search within statuses or filter by keywords, tags, or date.
- Author & Metadata Display:- 
Although it’s your personal feed, optionally display additional metadata: device used, approximate mood (e.g. emoji), location (if relevant), or a sortable “reaction” metric.
- Random Thought" Generator:- 
Add a button: “Give me a random thought”
It loads a random status using Hugo’s .Shuffle or JavaScript.
- “Printed Mode”:- Add a /print version of your feed:
Clean, typographic-only version
Could be printed and saved as an annual “status diary”. Bonus points for cover page + yearly summaries
- A goals tracker. Make a workflow to upload study times to website. 
- mood tracker? 
- audio and video support?
