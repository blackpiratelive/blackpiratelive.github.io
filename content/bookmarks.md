## Opensource Android Apps
This list contains opensource apps that I have used over the years which are not very well known. I would update this list from time to time. 

1. [Ente Auth](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.auth/) - Its a TOTP app. After using Aegis for a long time I moved to this. I use it alongside KeePass's own TOTP feature. It syncs the TOTP automatically. 
2. [Kvaesitso](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.mm20.launcher2.release/) - A homescreen launcher that I come back to everytime. The killing feature is swipe to search apps, since most of time I open apps by searching. It also has a place to put widgets which looks pretty and clean. You can access that page by swiping up. 
3. [DAVx‚Åµ](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/) - This app lets me sync my contacts and calenders. 
4. [Gitjournal](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal) - This is the app I use to post [status updates](https://status.blackpiratex.com) to my website. You can use it as a notes app and sync using git. 
5. [Futo Keyboard](https://keyboard.futo.org/) - My choice of keyboard app. It's really good once you get the hang of it. Made by Louis Rossman. I quit Gboard finally after starting to use this. 9/10 so far. 
6. [LocalSend](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.localsend.localsend_app/) - Easy to use file sharing app. Works on same WiFi. I use it occasionally to share files between devices. 
7. [Birday](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.minar.birday/)- A birthday manager app. Helps me to remember birthdays of friends and acquaintances.
8. [SongSync](https://github.com/Lambada10/SongSync) - Helps you to find lyric (synced) for your music.
9. [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) - This app doesn't need an introduction. I use this app to study. One of the best. 
10. [Pano Scrobbler](https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler) - This is my choice of app for scrobbling music I'm currently playing. Very reliable and has lots of feature. _Even let's you view monthly statistics without premium._
