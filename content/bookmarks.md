## Opensource Android Apps
This list contains opensource apps that I have used over the years which are not very well known. I would update this list from time to time. 

1. [Ente Auth](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.auth/) - Its a TOTP app. After using Aegis for a long time I moved to this. I use it alongside KeePass's own TOTP feature. It syncs the TOTP automatically. 
2. [Kvaesitso](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.mm20.launcher2.release/) - A homescreen launcher that I come back to everytime. The killing feature is swipe to search apps, since most of time I open apps by searching. It also has a place to put widgets which looks pretty and clean. You can access that page by swiping up. 
3. [DAVx‚Åµ](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/) - This app lets me sync my contacts and calenders. 
4. [Gitjournal](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal) - This is the app I use to post [status updates](https://status.blackpiratex.com) to my website. You can use it as a notes app and sync using git. 
5. [Futo Keyboard](https://keyboard.futo.org/) - My choice of keyboard app. It's really good once you get the hang of it. Made by Louis Rossman. I quit Gboard finally after starting to use this. 9/10 so far. 
6. [LocalSend](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.localsend.localsend_app/) - Easy to use file sharing app. Works on same WiFi. I use it occasionally to share files between devices. 
7. [Birday](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.minar.birday/)- A birthday manager app. Helps me to remember birthdays of friends and acquaintances.
8. [SongSync](https://github.com/Lambada10/SongSync) - Helps you to find lyric (synced) for your music.
9. [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android) - This app doesn't need an introduction. I use this app to study. One of the best. 
10. [Pano Scrobbler](https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler) - This is my choice of app for scrobbling music I'm currently playing. Very reliable and has lots of feature. _Even let's you view monthly statistics without premium._


## Services That I Use

**Password Manager**: Right now I use [Keepass](https://keepass.info/) as my password manager. I have used all the major password managers in the past. Really liked Bitwarden but quit due to lag on android apps. I use [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android) and [Keepassdx](https://www.keepassdx.com/) on Android, and [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) on Windows and Linux.

**Cloud Storage:** For cloud storage I use both free and open source as well as proprietary solutions. Google photos is my choice for keeping my photos and videos. I use [Disroot Cloud](https://cloud.disroot.org) for miscellaneous stuffs. 

**Email:** I use [protonmail](https://proton.me) (free) for my email. I also use [Disroot email](https://disroot.org) for newsletters. I do have gmail accounts and those are for very important stuffs. I also use [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io) for email aliasing and to host email on my domain. 

**Contact and Calender Sync:** I use [Fruux](https://fruux.com/) to sync my contacts and Calender. It gets the job done, I have no complaints. 

**Search:** For searching the web I use [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com) on my Firefox. Sometimes Google also. I have used [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) in the past and its also good. 

**DNS:** My choice of DNS is [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/). It's highly configurable and privacy friendly(?). I also sometimes use Adguard DNS (dns.adguard.com).
