                <ol class="book-highlights">
                    
                    <li>They live with it because they know that a prison is like a big pressure cooker, and there have to be vents somewhere to let off steam. They make the occasional bust, and I’ve done time in solitary a time or three over the years, but when it’s something like posters, they wink. Live and let live.</li>
                    
                    <li>You may remember the old question, the one that’s supposed to define your outlook on life when you answer it. For Byron Hadley the answer would always be half empty, the glass is half empty. Forever and ever, amen. If you gave him a cool drink of apple cider, he’d think about vinegar. If you told him his wife had always been faithful to him, he’d tell you it was because she was so damn ugly.</li>
                    
                    <li>As usual, the state in all its wisdom had let him go long after any chance he might have had to become a useful part of society was gone. He was sixty- eight and arthritic when he tottered out of the main gate in his Polish suit and his French shoes, his parole papers in one hand and a Greyhound bus ticket in the other. He was crying, then he left. Shawshank was his world. What lay beyond its vails was as terrible to Brooks as the Western Seas had been to superstitious 13th- century sailors. In prison, Brooksie had been a person of some importance. He was the head librarian, an educated man. If he went to the Kittery library and asked or a job, they wouldn’t give him a library card.</li>
                    
                    <li>the amount of expert financial help an individual or company needs rises in direct proportion to how many people that person or business is screwing.</li>
                    
                    <li>‘Yeah, I know. There’s a fine line there. What it comes down to, Red, is some people refuse to get their hands dirty at all. That’s called sainthood, and the pigeons land on your shoulders and crap all over your shirt. The other extreme is to take a bath in the dirt and deal any goddamned thing that will turn a dollar— guns, switchblades, big H, what the hell. You ever have a con come up to you and offer you a contract?’</li>
                    
                    <li>‘But you don’t do it. Because guys like us, Red, we know there’s a third choice. An alternative to staying simon- pure or bathing in the filth and the slime. It’s the alternative that grown- ups all over the world pick. You balance off your walk through the hog- wallow against what it gains you. You choose the lesser of two evils and try to keep your good intentions in front of you. And I guess you judge how well you’re doing by how well you sleep at night… and what your dreams are like.’</li>
                    
                    <li>One day in 1958 I looked at myself in a small shaving mirror I kept in my cell and saw a forty- year- old man looking back at me. A kid had come in back in 1938, a kid with a big mop of carrotty red hair, half- crazy with remorse, thinking about suicide. That kid was gone. The red hair was half grey and starting to recede. There were crow’s tracks around the eyes. On that day I could see an old man inside, waiting his time to come out. It scared me. Nobody wants to grow old in stir.</li>
                    
                    <li>I’ve still got them, and I take them down every so often and think about what a man can do, if he has time enough and the will to use it, a drop at a time.</li>
                    
                    <li>When you take away a man’s freedom and teach him to live in a cell, he seems to lose his ability to think in dimensions. He’s like that jackrabbit I mentioned, frozen in the oncoming lights of the truck that is bound to kill it.</li>
                    
                    <li>It stirred up more memories than I ever would have believed. Writing about yourself seems to be a lot like sticking a branch into clear river- water and roiling up the muddy bottom.</li>
                    
                    <li>Well, you weren’t writing about yourself, I hear someone in the peanut- gallery saying. You were writing about Andy Dufresne. You’re nothing but a minor character in your own story. But you know, that’s just not so. It’s all about me, every damned word of it. Andy was the part of me they could never lock up, the part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and I walk out in my cheap suit with my twenty dollars of mad- money in my pocket. That part of me will rejoice no matter how old and broken and scared the rest of me is. I guess it’s just that Andy had more of that part than me, and used it better.</li>
                    
                    <li>Some birds are not meant to be caged, that’s all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.</li>
                    
                    <li>I thought I had put finish to my story in a Shawshank prison cell on a bleak January day in 1976. Now it’s late June of 1977 and I am sitting in a small, cheap room of the Brewster Hotel in Portland, adding to it. The window is open, and the sound of the traffic floating in seems huge, exciting, and intimidating. I have to look constantly over at the window and reassure myself that there are no bars on it. I sleep poorly at night because the bed in this room, as cheap as the room is, seems much too big and luxurious. I snap awake every morning promptly at six- thirty, feeling disorientated and frightened. My dreams are bad. I have a crazy feeling of free fall. The sensation is as terrifying as it is exhilarating.</li>
                    
                    <li>That’s what a whole life in prison does for you, young man. It turns everyone in a position of authority into a master, and you into every master’s dog. Maybe you know you’ve become a dog, even in prison, but since everyone else in grey is a dog, too, it doesn’t seem to matter so much. Outside, it does. But I couldn’t tell a young guy like him. He would never understand.</li>
                    
                    <li>If I had never known Andy, I probably would have done that. But I kept thinking of him, spending all those years chipping patiently away at the cement with his rock- hammer so he could be free. I thought of that and it made me ashamed and I’d drop the idea again. Oh, you can say he had more reason to be free than I did— he had a new identity and a lot of money. But that’s not really true, you know. Because he didn’t know for sure that the new identity was still there, and without the new identity, the money would always be out of reach. No, what he needed was just to be free, and if I kicked away what I had, it would be like spitting in the face of everything he had worked so hard to win back.</li>
                    
                    <li>A fool’s errand… but so is chipping at a blank concrete wall for twenty- eight years. And when you’re no longer the man who can get it for you and just an old bag- boy, it’s nice to have a hobby to take your mind off your new life. My hobby was looking for Andy’s rock.</li>
                    
                    <li>Remember that hope is a good thing, Red, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.</li>
                    
                    <li>Wondering what I should do. But there’s really no question. It always comes down to just two choices. Get busy living or get busy dying.</li>
                    
                    <li>I hope Andy is down there. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope..</li>
