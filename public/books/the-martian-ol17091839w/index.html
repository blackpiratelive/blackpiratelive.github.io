        <td>I’m pretty much fucked. That’s my considered opinion. Fucked., How come Aquaman can control whales? They’re mammals! Makes no sense., [12: 04] JPL: We’ll get botanists in to ask detailed questions and double- check your work. Your life is at stake, so we want to be sure. Sol 900 is great news. It’ll give us a lot more time to get the supply mission together. Also, please watch your language. Everything you type is being broadcast live all over the world. [12: 15] WATNEY: Look! A pair of boobs! -&gt; (. Y.), Tomorrow night, I’ll sink to an all- new low! Lemme rephrase that.… Tomorrow night, I’ll be at rock bottom! No, that doesn’t sound good either.… Tomorrow night, I’ll be in Giovanni Schiaparelli’s favorite hole! Okay, I admit I’m just playing around now., The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to save one dorky botanist. Why bother? Well, okay. I know the answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science, and the interplanetary future we’ve dreamed of for centuries. But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but it’s true., If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it’s found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don’t care, but they’re massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side.</td>
