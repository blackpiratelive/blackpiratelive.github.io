        <td>Kids make a mess of everything. Especially when they start chewing gum. They all go through a gum phase— at least, a lot of them do— and they leave it everywhere., Human suffering is often an abstract concept to kids. But animal suffering is something else entirely., I plop down onto a stool and stare at the cylinder. What a strange artifact. What do I even call noble gases that react with things? Ignobles?, What if Eridians have a life- span of 2 million years and waiting a century to reply is considered polite?, Wow. I’m sitting here in a spaceship in the Tau Ceti system waiting for the intelligent aliens I just met to continue our conversation… and I’m bored. Human beings have a remarkable ability to accept the abnormal and make it normal., I am not rested at all. Every pore of my being yells at me to go back to sleep, but I told Rocky I’d be back in two hours and I wouldn’t want him to think humans are untrustworthy. I mean… we’re pretty untrustworthy, but I don’t want him to know that., Oh thank God. I can’t imagine explaining “sleep” to someone who had never heard of it. Hey, I’m going to fall unconscious and hallucinate for a while. By the way, I spend a third of my time doing this. And if I can’t do it for a while, I go insane and eventually die. No need for concern., “I don’t like little dictators in their little kingdoms,” she said. “Drives me crazy.”, She nodded. “Humanity’s recklessness with our environment accidentally bought us an extra month of time by pre- heating the planet.” “We fell in poop and came out smelling like roses,” I said., “We’ll have to hope so. The Russian woman— Ilyukhina— is on the prime crew as well. She’s a materials expert and by far the best candidate for the task. The science expert is Martin DuBois— the American man. Two men and one woman. Recipe for disaster.”, “Hello!” Ilyukhina lunged forward and hugged Stratt. “I’m here to die for Earth! Pretty awesome, yes?!” I leaned to Dimitri. “Are all Russians crazy?” “Yes,” he said with a smile. “It is the only way to be Russian and happy at the same time.”, IVME was an acronym that stood for four words God never intended to be together: “in vacuo microbiology equipment.” Astrophage lives in space. We could study them on Earth in our atmosphere all we wanted, but we wouldn’t get the full picture of how they worked until we studied them in vacuum and in zero g. The crew of the Hail Mary would need these tools., An entire planet of intelligent people put together a ship based on incorrect scientific assumptions, and by some miracle, the sole survivor of the crew was clever enough at trial- and- error problem solving to actually get it to its destination. And out of that major screw- up comes my salvation. They thought they’d need a whole lot more fuel. So Rocky has boatloads to spare., Do you believe in God? I know it’s a personal question. I do. And I think He was pretty awesome to make relativity a thing, don’t you? The faster you go, the less time you experience. It’s like He’s inviting us to explore the universe, you know?”, One thing I learned back in my graduate school days: When you’re stupid tired, accept that you’re stupid tired. Don’t try to solve things right then., Three days off the painkillers and I’m a lot smarter than I was. At least he understands that much— I wasn’t just some stupid human. I was a human with enhanced stupidity., “You’re a coward and you always have been. You abandoned a promising scientific career because people didn’t like a paper you wrote. You retreated to the safety of children who worship you for being the cool teacher. You don’t have a romantic partner in your life because that would mean you might suffer heartbreak. You avoid risk like the plague.”, “I was eighteen years old and had no idea what to do with my life. I majored in history because I didn’t know what else to do.” She smirked. “Hard to imagine me like that, eh?”</td>
