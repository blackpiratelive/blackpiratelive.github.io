        <td>“There’s no such thing as perfect writing. Just like there’s no such thing as perfect despair.”, Of course, there’s a limit to how much you can try to learn about things, but it’s not as painful as being old. At least, that’s what they say., “People with dark souls have nothing but dark dreams. People with really dark souls do nothing but dream,”, With civilization comes communication, he said. Whatever can’t be expressed might as well not exist. Nil, nothing. Suppose you’re hungry. You say, ‘I’m hungry,’ and even that short phrase will suffice. I’ll give you a cookie. You can eat it. (I was now holding a cookie.) If you say nothing, there’s no cookie. (The psychiatrist then hid the plate of cookies under the table with a sadistic look on his face.) Nothing. You get it? You don’t want to talk. But you’re hungry. Without making words, you can’t express your hunger. Here’s a gesture game. Come watch this. I grabbed my stomach like it was hurting. The psychiatrist laughed. I had indigestion., It’s really difficult to talk about dead people, but it’s even harder to talk about dead young women. It’s because from the time they die, they’ll be young forever., It’s really difficult to talk about dead people, but it’s even harder to talk about dead young women. It’s because from the time they die, they’ll be young forever. On the other hand, for us, the survivors, every year, every month, every day, we get older. Sometimes, I feel like I can feel myself aging from one hour to the next. It’s a terrible thing, but that’s reality., “Kind of,” I said, “still, think about this. Everyone’s built the same. It’s like we’re all riding together on a broken airplane. Of course there are lucky people, there are also unlucky people. There’re tough people, and weak people, rich people, and poor people. However, not a single person’s broken the mold with his toughness. We’re all the same. Everyone who has something is afraid of losing it, and people with nothing are worried they’ll forever have nothing. Everyone is the same. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you’ll want to get stronger. Even if you’re just pretending. Don’t you think?, There aren’t any real strong people anywhere. Only people who can put on a good show of being strong.”, “If writers only wrote about things everybody knew, what the hell would be the point of writing?”, What I’ve learned during my three years of lying in this hospital bed is that even from whatever miserable experience you might have, there is something to be learned, and it’s because of this that I can find the will to keep on living., “What you give freely to others, you will always receive in turn.”, Am I happy? If you asked me this, I’d have to say, ‘Yeah, I guess.’ Because dreams are, after all, just that: dreams., “In the light of day, one can comprehend the depths of night’s darkness.”, “Compared to the complexity of the universe,” Hartfield says, “our world’s like the brain tissue of an earthworm.”</td>
