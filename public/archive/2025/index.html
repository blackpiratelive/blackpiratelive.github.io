                <p>So after trying to write for last two years, I think I am going to finish writing this year.
Lets tackle different aspects of my life one by one.</p>
<h2 id="studies">Studies</h2>
<p>I finished my graduation this year on July-August. My college life is finally over, trying to take entry into work life and leave this student life behind. I do not plan on higher studies. Only places that I need higher degrees is in teaching related jobs, and I do not plan on doing those, trying to avoid it.
I started preparing for govt-competitive exams this year seriously. Gave CGL pre for the first time, (mains in scheduled on January next year). MTS didnt happen yet this year. CHSL I wasn&rsquo;t able to give due to distance of exam center. Gave Clarkship Mains at the end of the year.
Am I satisfied with my performance? Um, yes but actually no. I am scared, I think current studying is not adequate to get any good job.
Can I improve it? Yes i can. I want to average around 4-5 hours per day of study in 2026. It is not really ambitious. I am currently studying 3 hours on average (maybe a little less).
What things I want to change in 2026? I want to be just as good in maths like I am in English. I know I can do it. All I need to do is give one mock everyday, WHATEVER HAPPENS, just ONE mock.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>First talk about friendships. I knew I am going to be lonely after I finish college, and it happened, no surprise there. Only a few friends are remaining. Whom I thought would be good friends even after college, no longer much of a friends anymore. And friends whom I didnt care about much and were merely acquaintances, they now talk more often. In hindsight I feel like I should have ended a few friendships but it&rsquo;s harder. This is the first time I am staying in a friendship even if I don&rsquo;t want to. Which friend talks for an hour almost and then say &ldquo;it was nice talking with you&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s irritating.
And about romantic relationship, It&rsquo;s not juicy anymore. Boring. I went to meet my college crush after changing city. Only once we did meet. I am supposed to go by the end of January.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I gained weight last year (It&rsquo;s not a bad thing, it is deliberate). I was skinny, now I am a big guy. Im now hovering around 75-80kgs. I should be mindful about my diet. This year every inch of my body has changed. It&rsquo;s Puberty 2.0. I had to give up almost all my clothes and switch to newer bigger ones. Shirts, T shirts and all my jeans dont fit me anymore. As far as I remember I didnt get sick much this year. If  I have to attribute this to something it would be probably because I tracked my calorie intake for 3 months straight and always fulfilled the daily requirements. It was a good habit but takes too much attention everyday.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>
<p>I travelled some new places this year. The main highlight being Ranchi, Jharkhand. I talked about it <a href="https://blog.blackpiratex.com/ranchi-experience/">here</a>. For CGL mains I went to Kolkata, the usual city. With [redacted] I visited St. Pauls Cathedral and Victoria Memorial. I went there after 10 years. Initially I visited those in class 8th. At the end of the year I spent the night in Durgapur, and also visited Barddhaman.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>I bought a new tablet for studies. My laptop is completely broke now. Phone also broke this year. (display)
I built lot of small and medium apps for my personal use through AI. The main highlight being my <a href="https://diary.sudipx.in">Diary app</a>. I am going to do a prediction and say that AI is here to stay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expecptionally good performance academically. (I have to maintain this and improve on it in 2026) . All the goals I have set for myself was met. Some of it was luck too, I want to thank the universe and God for that.</li>
<li>Did one of the stupidest, courageous and adventurous thing in my life. I am yet to know its result. If it becomes successful, I will have a story to tell.</li>
</ul>

                <p>Some birds are not meant to be caged, that&rsquo;s all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.</p>

                <p>I went to see something by my college road. But in the way we met a weird person. It looked like a mentally unstable person. We were teasing him. He started following us. Then halfway through the journey, there was a shop type 2 story building. He quickly changed and transformed into a girl. Yep, he was trans.
He kept following us. Now we are in the bhamuria Road, but I am actually going to the sammilani college. I was supposed to drop off at bhamuria more but i did not.</p>
<p>After crossing my mom&rsquo;s school, i thought enough is enough and decided to get off from the toto. I had two- 3 friends with me. But they were scared. I was scared too but didn&rsquo;t show it.
I approached the person, who is now a girl. He tried to make some magic, like eleven in stranger things style. But nothing happened. I confronted her. She said shes like this because of animal cruelty. She showed me a document of all the animal cruelty happened. It had also the recent dogs judgement by SC. But there was something odd at the bottom. A script. I read it and knew instantly what it does. I confronted her again, what does this script do? It look little bit of pressure for her to talk. She had that devilish smile. That little script changes any text you type to &ldquo;I agree with everything&rdquo;. So it was a cult. I said.
But me being me, I do not know what happened, and I started flirting. Called her madam and what not. Then she left and we resumed our journey.
We took another toto and bargained. I was supposed to drop at my school and my other friends would go to their house. When I was crossing my school I was screaming that drop me off here, but he did not. Ultimately I was dropped off near a friend&rsquo;s house. When i went to pay 15 rs there was not enough change. One odd thing that i noticed was new coins, mostly in odd numbers 17, 19 rupee coins, these dont exist. There was 20rs coin also, I once saw it in real life and touched it. But someone else have it, not me. I have no idea how I had those coins in my wallet. I paid 50rs and told my friends, so they pay the difference. I entered, because its rude not to enter after coming that close and not go in. I ate some snacks there and she was there. But we didnt talk and she did not acknowledge me.</p>
<p>I came out took a toto to go to my home.</p>

Guest house for students was significantly cheaper and closer to the exam centre, I had trouble finding room at Kolkata for cheap, when I went there alone after passing 12th.</p>
<h1 id="terrain">Terrain:</h1>
<p>I thought I knew what plateu looks like, uh no, I did not. The landscape is so plateu like, which is exoected as this is part of Chotonagpur plateu. The part of Chotonagpur plateu that i am familier with is Vastly different from what I saw here. Most of the area is covered by trees, these are not deep forests I assume because there was trails, and agricultural lands in between. Whenever there&rsquo;s plain, theres either human settlement or agricultural land or both.</p>
<p>The railway tracks are on same level, (honestly i doubt i would be able to tell even if there&rsquo;s a slope) but the immediate srroundings change rapidly, sometimes when I look through the window the landscape is below me and I can see the top of the trees. And sometimes I see walls of rocks, marked by the breakings created by the human, obtructing the farland from my view. When I arrived at Ranchi I came through Muri, and  I returned through Barkakana, Hazaribag, Koderma, Madhupur, Chittaranjan and then Asansol. When I was on train to Ranchi I did saw those rocks that had been cut to make road for the railway track. But when I was returning there was something different. The rocks had been cut but also there were webs made up of iron(probably) that was used to hold the walls. It is so that any rocks don&rsquo;t fall on the track. (Or wrose fall when train is passing by.)</p>

<p>The waterfalls are everywhere. These are not big for a  tourist attraction, I saw them from the window of the train. I was able to catch only one in my phone camera. No wonder Ranchi is called city of waterfalls.</p>

                <p>Ideas that i may wanna implement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timeline or Calendar View: -
Generate a calendar heatmap showing volume of posts per day/month (e.g. GitHub‑style activity grid) or a vertical timeline view for easier browsing.</li>
<li>Search or Filterable UI:-
Install client-side search (like Algolia/Tipue or simple Lunr.js) to allow users to search within statuses or filter by keywords, tags, or date.</li>
<li>Author &amp; Metadata Display:-
Although it’s your personal feed, optionally display additional metadata: device used, approximate mood (e.g. emoji), location (if relevant), or a sortable “reaction” metric.</li>
<li>Random Thought&quot; Generator:-
Add a button: “Give me a random thought”
It loads a random status using Hugo’s .Shuffle or JavaScript.</li>
<li>“Printed Mode”:- Add a /print version of your feed:
Clean, typographic-only version
Could be printed and saved as an annual “status diary”. Bonus points for cover page + yearly summaries</li>
<li>A goals tracker. Make a workflow to upload study times to website.</li>
<li>mood tracker?</li>
<li>audio and video support?</li>

                <p>Im having the dreams again.
My teacher is a communist and somehow leaked to a stranger that he is communist. There was a trick to calculate distance of something by using a very small amount of sand. You have to use an arrow and throw it so it touches only the top of the sand. I was begging the guy not tp harm my teacher. I have no idea if he was on side of us or against us.</p>

                <p>“You know what I think?&quot; she says. &ldquo;That people&rsquo;s memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They&rsquo;re all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed &rsquo;em to the fire, they&rsquo;re all just paper. The fire isn&rsquo;t thinking &lsquo;Oh, this is Kant,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Oh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Nice tits,&rsquo; while it burns. To the fire, they&rsquo;re nothing but scraps of paper. It&rsquo;s the exact same thing. Important memories, not-so-important memories, totally useless memories: there&rsquo;s no distinction&ndash;they&rsquo;re all just fuel.”
― Haruki Murakami, After Dark</p>

                <p>I was someone else. Probably my brother and saw myself waiting in a hall. It was our college exam and somehow I forgot to do form fillup.</p>
<p>The me, in someone else&rsquo;s body went to a hotel, but overheard the owner giving instructions to raise the prices for the students who came to give exam. So I left. The exam centre was right beside Ganga. So I reached one of the Gangas ghat, and when I entered the exam centre again it was the hall where all people who were not eligible was sitting and someone was instructing them to go with with to some office. I saw myself there. Sad and still smiling. I was going to scold &ldquo;me&rdquo; but then that&rsquo;s the point when I realised it&rsquo;s me who&rsquo;s forgot. Suhana was also there, I went and sat beside her and asked why she&rsquo;s here. She said because they won&rsquo;t open the other doors yet.</p>
<p>We have a gurden in our house. It&rsquo;s very big, bigger than my original home&rsquo;s garden. But it was the garden at my house. I was walking there looking at trees. I found a string and when I pulled it up, a magnet came out. It was disc like and surprisingly shiny(like tablet battery, but bigger). I thought to myself Its the same magnet that I extracted from the TV in my childhood. (But it isn&rsquo;t, the real one was black, not shiny and it was not a disc, but ring shaped.) I took it. The weight was heavy, I can definitely feel it.
I found a mango at the upper right corner of the garden. At first I noticed coconuts which were broken but looked fresh, I touched it and realised they were spoiled, so mom probably threw them out.
Suddenly I noticed that I&rsquo;m inside a boundary made of bamboos and wires. But it was much stronger and it looked like it was made by professional. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the wires had tiny led bulbs, those RGB lights. They were blinking, since it was daytime I only noticed when I came close.
I saw searching for more mangos at this point. (We have 6-7 mango trees in real life) I was going from one tree from another. But to no avail. I also saw my grandmother doing the same, but we didn&rsquo;t talk.
When I was searching, as I was inside the boundary made of wires I wasn&rsquo;t able to get very close to the mango trees, so I have no idea how I would have grabbed the mango if I had found any more.
Inside the wired fences, there was flower garden. At first I noticed roses, the colors were pink but they weren&rsquo;t big, rather miniature version of roses, I thought to myself they must grow big later.
There were other flowers also. Which I didn&rsquo;t notice that well. But overall the garden was VERY well maintained. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like something my mom would be able to do alone.
Now I wanted to get out from inside these wired fences. I looked for it. I reached the very south of the garden. (I started my journey from East) The fences were higher this time, taller than me maybe double my height. At the west side there was an exit. The fence had ended. The boundary made up of bricks had also ended there,  it was meant to be a door but only the gap  is available not the door.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m about to go out, two bikes came, I have no idea who they were. One bike saw me and to stop slightly hit the wall and missed the gap, the 2nd bike then came along and went through the gap inside the boundary of our house, at this point it was no longer my home. Some other playground, which maybe of my college, my brother&rsquo;s college or my school&rsquo;s playground. Or the amalgamation of three.</p>
<p>Before this scene happened, there was another scene.
I was at my home and we were making different type of new recipes, all are some kind of deep friend thing. It included pork. I tasted pork too (I have never tasted pork in real life) and it tasted like &ldquo;blank&rdquo;. Literally nothing. I guess my mind can&rsquo;t dream new information.
There was another guy (probably brother) I asked him to give one from his plate. He had four. But didn&rsquo;t give any. I said I gave you mine, so why are you saying no? He said nope. I accused him of being selfish and he didn&rsquo;t even show any reaction. Mom was there being a silent audience. I felt like crying but didn&rsquo;t. The ones that we made earlier were inside a box (trunk type).  I sneaked at one time and stole 4 pieces of those deep fried things. Here I have to mention that we were making different dishes. This one that I stole was neither mine nor my brother&rsquo;s. It was different but at least that made me cope with it. I didn&rsquo;t talk with anyone after stealing and went outside where scene 2 happened. It felt better.</p>

                <p>A common criticism of Indian Constitution is that it is made by lawyers, so its &ldquo;Paradise for lawyers&rdquo; but isn&rsquo;t it good thing?

                <p>There&rsquo;s so many types of monogamy. Humans are serial monogamist. i.e. they are monogamous at a particular time, but would change partner after 2-3 years (in general, through all cultures). Which is roughly the same time between two childs.</p>

                <p>Main character me, brother and another guy. Who is black.</p>
<p>I was cleaning a toilet because it was overflowing. That made vomit reflex and woke me up. Took me at least 3-4 tries to finish cleaning</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another scene where 3 of us were walking at the side of a road/railway. Suddenly a tank came and blocked the whole road. Veichles came fast and crashed into it. 2nd vehicle broke the tank itself. It happened very quickly in less than a minute and we can hear injured people crying.
I was scared because I was worried if some debris would come hitting us and injure us.
We left the scene quickly. It started to rain and we took shelter in a building. This building I have never seen before, it was big, a lot like shopping mall but abandoned. There was lots of people though who were seeking refuge in this rain. I was the first one to reach the building. But even after waiting for a while brother didn&rsquo;t come, so anxiety took over and I went looking for him. I thought he probably lost direction. He was alone. Which was odd, but expected. I asked where the other guy was and he said that there&rsquo;s some people looking for him and want to beat him up, so he went into hiding. I was on top of the balcony and saw two guys looking for someone, one guy had a big stick on his hand. I knew this guy. At first I was scared to make eye contact. But soon realised that they weren&rsquo;t looking for me, so I made eye contact. I even thought of trying to persuade them to stop from hurting that guy. I talked with them, but memories of what happened is fuzzy.</p>
<p>In another scene mom was all alone in this rain at home which made me very sad, it was raining heavily.</p>
<p>In another scene I was in the charge for fixing the plumbing of the house. The plumber came and did the work haphazardly and I had to supervise them to fix it properly. At this time brother was in studying in front of a tuition teacher. The teacher was most probably CC sir.</p>
<p>Oh and there was a map of some place. Which I think I have seen before in another dream but not sure.</p>

                <blockquote>
<p>I dreamt this after drinking coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had my first experience of riding  an aeroplane.  It was riding very low and the windows were not glass.  It was like a toy and it was fun.</p>
<p>Then in train Pabitra had a bhai who was not found. He said his brother came with us but he was not sure if actially. He said that he would say that he is dead and instructed us to make a fake dead body to show in case. I once heard someone crying and calling &ldquo;dada&rdquo; but cannot figure out from where and who it was. Trying to find, we found the snake. The snake was scaring an animal which was neither dog not a cat, rather a mixture of two. There was a snake in the train. Actually two. Some people caught it. I also hold it in my hands and didn&rsquo;t let it bite me..
At the final dream I don&rsquo;t remember its fraustating,
I woke after the 2nd sleep, thought about writing down and repeated in my mind what I dreamt then slept and saw the third dream. Maybe because of repeatation I was able to remember.
I took coffee just before sleep.</p>

<p>I dreamt this on 9th Jan, 2025. I drank coffee that day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I dreamt that I was with mom and we were trying dishes</p>
<p>There was a girl who was ironing some fabric that was supposed to be edible. She burnt some fabric and also in the process her sweater. Her dad took it from her and started doing it. I don&rsquo;t know what it tasted becase we didn&rsquo;t get to taste it.</p>
<p>Then we were painting a house in black, the paint was being done in small black cubes. Light blue was under the black paint. I told mom that we were gonna make a gradient. So after  a while we are going to skip one cubes then two then 3 so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Brother wasn&rsquo;t there, there were other persons. I called him first and he said that his laptop was stolen. But based the descriptuon he gave it was more  broken than stolen. I didn&rsquo;t tell that to mom first. Then Mon called after a while and they talked long about it.</p>
<p>He gave the laptop to repair somewhere but instead of repairing they broke it.</p>
