      <description>SimpleLogin is a email aliasing service. Which basically means you can create as many emails as you want* and all those emails would land on single inbox. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using SimpleLogin for over a year now.

I don&amp;rsquo;t want fifty different companies to know my email address just so they can send me marketing emails.</description>
