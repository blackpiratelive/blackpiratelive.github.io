      <title>Simplelogin - Best Way to Manage Your Emails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SimpleLogin is a email aliasing service. Which basically means you can create as many emails as you want* and all those emails would land on single inbox. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using SimpleLogin for over a year now. Here&amp;rsquo;s my evaluation of the service. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-use-case&#34;&gt;My Use Case&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As someone who cares about privacy, and had personal emails leaked in data breach previously, I treat emails just like my passwords. I don&amp;rsquo;t want fifty different companies to know my email address just so they can send me marketing emails. Also if you use same email everywhere its pretty easy to stalk you online. Anyone who has your email address would be able to know if you use (or have account) certain website. I don&amp;rsquo;t want others to know which website I visit or which website I have an&#xA;account. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-nextdns&#34;&gt;What is NextDNS?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NextDNS is a dns service which lets you block sites at dns level. That means it can block ads and trackers. Which is the main selling point of this service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
