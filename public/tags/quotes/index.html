                            <p>“You know what I think?&quot; she says. &ldquo;That people&rsquo;s memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive. Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. They&rsquo;re all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: when you feed &rsquo;em to the fire, they&rsquo;re all just paper. The fire isn&rsquo;t thinking &lsquo;Oh, this is Kant,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Oh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Nice tits,&rsquo; while it burns. To the fire, they&rsquo;re nothing but scraps of paper. It&rsquo;s the exact same thing. Important memories, not-so-important memories, totally useless memories: there&rsquo;s no distinction&ndash;they&rsquo;re all just fuel.”
― Haruki Murakami, After Dark</p>

Now science is a valid way of seeing the universe, religion is a valid way of seeing the universe and they have the difference  between prose and poetry.

The remaining ninety-nine percent is just living in waiting.

Oh, life is too painful, the reality that confirms the universal belief that it is best not to be born.”</p>

<p><strong>Explaination:</strong></p>
<p>Read through the thread. Look how many stories there are of people losing years and years to something that they now regret. The realization is that this is the norm, not the exception. We&rsquo;re all just fragile and fallible and trying to make our way through life as best we can, and we all end up messing up big somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to look back on 10 wasted years and think you failed, you blew your one chance at life. But if you come to realize that looking back on 10 wasted years is actually a common human struggle, it can help you reframe your regret as just another one of the trials of being a limited, mortal human and not take it so personally as your own failing.</p>
