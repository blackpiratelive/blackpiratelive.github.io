      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to see something by my college road. But in the way we met a weird person. It looked like a mentally unstable person. We were teasing him. He started following us. Then halfway through the journey, there was a shop type 2 story building. He quickly changed and transformed into a girl. Yep, he was trans.&#xA;He kept following us. Now we are in the bhamuria Road, but I am actually going to the sammilani college. I was supposed to drop off at bhamuria more but i did not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was someone else. Probably my brother and saw myself waiting in a hall. It was our college exam and somehow I forgot to do form fillup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The me, in someone else&amp;rsquo;s body went to a hotel, but overheard the owner giving instructions to raise the prices for the students who came to give exam. So I left. The exam centre was right beside Ganga. So I reached one of the Gangas ghat, and when I entered the exam centre again it was the hall where all people who were not eligible was sitting and someone was instructing them to go with with to some office. I saw myself there. Sad and still smiling. I was going to scold &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; but then that&amp;rsquo;s the point when I realised it&amp;rsquo;s me who&amp;rsquo;s forgot. Suhana was also there, I went and sat beside her and asked why she&amp;rsquo;s here. She said because they won&amp;rsquo;t open the other doors yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dream: A Movie</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Main character me, brother and another guy. Who is black.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was cleaning a toilet because it was overflowing. That made vomit reflex and woke me up. Took me at least 3-4 tries to finish cleaning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another scene where 3 of us were walking at the side of a road/railway. Suddenly a tank came and blocked the whole road. Veichles came fast and crashed into it. 2nd vehicle broke the tank itself. It happened very quickly in less than a minute and we can hear injured people crying.&#xA;I was scared because I was worried if some debris would come hitting us and injure us.&#xA;We left the scene quickly. It started to rain and we took shelter in a building. This building I have never seen before, it was big, a lot like shopping mall but abandoned. There was lots of people though who were seeking refuge in this rain. I was the first one to reach the building. But even after waiting for a while brother didn&amp;rsquo;t come, so anxiety took over and I went looking for him. I thought he probably lost direction. He was alone. Which was odd, but expected. I asked where the other guy was and he said that there&amp;rsquo;s some people looking for him and want to beat him up, so he went into hiding. I was on top of the balcony and saw two guys looking for someone, one guy had a big stick on his hand. I knew this guy. At first I was scared to make eye contact. But soon realised that they weren&amp;rsquo;t looking for me, so I made eye contact. I even thought of trying to persuade them to stop from hurting that guy. I talked with them, but memories of what happened is fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I dreamt this after drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had my first experience of riding  an aeroplane.  It was riding very low and the windows were not glass.  It was like a toy and it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then in train Pabitra had a bhai who was not found. He said his brother came with us but he was not sure if actially. He said that he would say that he is dead and instructed us to make a fake dead body to show in case. I once heard someone crying and calling &amp;ldquo;dada&amp;rdquo; but cannot figure out from where and who it was. Trying to find, we found the snake. The snake was scaring an animal which was neither dog not a cat, rather a mixture of two. There was a snake in the train. Actually two. Some people caught it. I also hold it in my hands and didn&amp;rsquo;t let it bite me..&#xA;At the final dream I don&amp;rsquo;t remember its fraustating,&#xA;I woke after the 2nd sleep, thought about writing down and repeated in my mind what I dreamt then slept and saw the third dream. Maybe because of repeatation I was able to remember.&#xA;I took coffee just before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She burnt some fabric and also in the process her sweater. Her dad took it from her and started doing it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I dreamt again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time I was running away from people of an universe of exact same people of this universe. Actually it was parallel universe, everything is exact copy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bean like thing has corrupted mind of almost all the people of that parallel universe and made everyone evil.I wasn&amp;rsquo;t effected by those beans for some reason. But I had no idea that I was not effected. At first there were no beans, then suddenly beans were everywhere, like it was raining beans. I remember collecting them. These beans were round bright yellow in color. There&amp;rsquo;s a whole story about how these beans took over that parallel universe, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
