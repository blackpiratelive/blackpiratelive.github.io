      <description>&lt;p&gt;Im having the dreams again.&#xA;My teacher is a communist and somehow leaked to a stranger that he is communist. There was a trick to calculate distance of something by using a very small amount of sand. You have to use an arrow and throw it so it touches only the top of the sand. I was begging the guy not tp harm my teacher. I have no idea if he was on side of us or against us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
