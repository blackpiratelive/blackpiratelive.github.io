<hr>
<p>If you have visited my this blog before,(and can remember it) you can clearly see the difference. This blog is now simpler. I like it. Hope you  like it too. As I am going to get busy with my life, I hope I would stick with this theme for very long.</p>
<h3 id="how-this-website-is-made">How this website is made</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> for creating this website. Hugo is  great. I am loving it. Earlier also I was using Hugo, but that time I didn&rsquo;t know much about it, so I used a ready made theme for my website. This time the theme is mine. That is why it is so minimal. This theme uses only HTML and little bit of CSS, I would tweak as time goes on.  The inspiration came from <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a>, in this <a href="https://youtu.be/ZFL09qhKi5I/">video</a> he explained things about hugo, which has helped me a lot. So I made this. I knew that I was going to make my own theme someday, beacuse I do not like those available.</p>
<p>After I learn more about creating hugo themes, or actually how to use hugo, I shall also make new theme for my <a href="https://gallery.blackpiratex.com">gallery</a> website. It looks good, but it is slow. I would try to make it javascript free. Right now it uses so much javascript which makes it slow. I know that Hugo can compress images so I need to figure those things out before I move my gallery website to custom made theme.</p>
<h3 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h3>
<p>I would definitely love to get some feedback about how to improve my website. You can send me email at <a href="mailto:comments@blackpiratex.com">comments@blackpiratex.com</a> regarding this. If you think everything is right, give me few opinions about these -</p>
<ul>
<li>Shall I add comments using github issues?</li>
<li>Dark mode?</li>
<li>Search?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you.</p>
