<p>I dreamt again.</p>
<p>This time I was running away from people of an universe of exact same people of this universe. Actually it was parallel universe, everything is exact copy.</p>
<p>A bean like thing has corrupted mind of almost all the people of that parallel universe and made everyone evil.I wasn&rsquo;t effected by those beans for some reason. But I had no idea that I was not effected. At first there were no beans, then suddenly beans were everywhere, like it was raining beans. I remember collecting them. These beans were round bright yellow in color. There&rsquo;s a whole story about how these beans took over that parallel universe, but I don&rsquo;t remember much.</p>
<p>After they became evil, the only way to reproduce was by rape. They tried to kill me, I thought they would rape me but they were trying to take my eyes out with finger. It didn&rsquo;t hurt much also, there is slight hesitation in the guy who was trying to take my eyes out.</p>
<p>Suddenly while I was being tortured by the leader, A guy came and told the leader that 6 people were still not effected by the beans. The leader panicked and using that oppertunity I became free. This is the time I became aware that I was one of those 6 guys who were not effected.</p>
<p>I ran like crazy and met with two other uneffected guys and joined them. They had guns. I didn&rsquo;t. Those two guys removed the safety of the gun and pointed it towards the now-effected people, which resulted in them not moving forward to us.</p>
<p>Then somehow I left that parallel universe and came to my own original universe, where beans don&rsquo;t rule.</p>
<p>I was alone, running away from the people of that parallel universe who were trying to hunt me down. I would escape but won&rsquo;t be able to go very far. It was constant running.</p>
<p>While running I was almost hurt by a wooden needle like structure protruding from a wall. Someone I don&rsquo;t know stopped me and saved me from hitting it. I didn&rsquo;t even say thanks as far as I remember.</p>
<p>I also went to my mom, told her about it, ate with her and then ran away through her garden.</p>
<p>One guy was chasing me. I was running away from him. There were long big trees, a lot like Eucalyptus trees. Those trees were organised in a pattern, pointing to the fact that it was planted by people. Among those trees was a big mansion. There were walls srrounding the mansion. And there were doors, big doors that can allow a car to enter. Number of doors were more than one. It was locked in a way that you can open it from both sides. Trying to escape the guy, I opened one door and
entered, then locked the door again. He saw me entering. He came in from different door. At this point I was afraid and feeling lost, as I cannot figure out how to escape again. He almost caught me.</p>
<p>He saw the nameplate on the wall. It&rsquo;s his dad&rsquo;s house. Biological dad. His dad left him, when he was young. They had no contact. His dad has a new son. He started talking with his dad turning away from me. Catching the moment, I tried to escape.</p>
<p>I woke up, with sweats on my neck.</p>
