<hr>
<p>I was someone else. Probably my brother and saw myself waiting in a hall. It was our college exam and somehow I forgot to do form fillup.</p>
<p>The me, in someone else&rsquo;s body went to a hotel, but overheard the owner giving instructions to raise the prices for the students who came to give exam. So I left. The exam centre was right beside Ganga. So I reached one of the Gangas ghat, and when I entered the exam centre again it was the hall where all people who were not eligible was sitting and someone was instructing them to go with with to some office. I saw myself there. Sad and still smiling. I was going to scold &ldquo;me&rdquo; but then that&rsquo;s the point when I realised it&rsquo;s me who&rsquo;s forgot. Suhana was also there, I went and sat beside her and asked why she&rsquo;s here. She said because they won&rsquo;t open the other doors yet.</p>
<p>We have a gurden in our house. It&rsquo;s very big, bigger than my original home&rsquo;s garden. But it was the garden at my house. I was walking there looking at trees. I found a string and when I pulled it up, a magnet came out. It was disc like and surprisingly shiny(like tablet battery, but bigger). I thought to myself Its the same magnet that I extracted from the TV in my childhood. (But it isn&rsquo;t, the real one was black, not shiny and it was not a disc, but ring shaped.) I took it. The weight was heavy, I can definitely feel it.
I found a mango at the upper right corner of the garden. At first I noticed coconuts which were broken but looked fresh, I touched it and realised they were spoiled, so mom probably threw them out.
Suddenly I noticed that I&rsquo;m inside a boundary made of bamboos and wires. But it was much stronger and it looked like it was made by professional. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the wires had tiny led bulbs, those RGB lights. They were blinking, since it was daytime I only noticed when I came close.
I saw searching for more mangos at this point. (We have 6-7 mango trees in real life) I was going from one tree from another. But to no avail. I also saw my grandmother doing the same, but we didn&rsquo;t talk.
When I was searching, as I was inside the boundary made of wires I wasn&rsquo;t able to get very close to the mango trees, so I have no idea how I would have grabbed the mango if I had found any more.
Inside the wired fences, there was flower garden. At first I noticed roses, the colors were pink but they weren&rsquo;t big, rather miniature version of roses, I thought to myself they must grow big later.
There were other flowers also. Which I didn&rsquo;t notice that well. But overall the garden was VERY well maintained. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like something my mom would be able to do alone.
Now I wanted to get out from inside these wired fences. I looked for it. I reached the very south of the garden. (I started my journey from East) The fences were higher this time, taller than me maybe double my height. At the west side there was an exit. The fence had ended. The boundary made up of bricks had also ended there,  it was meant to be a door but only the gap  is available not the door.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m about to go out, two bikes came, I have no idea who they were. One bike saw me and to stop slightly hit the wall and missed the gap, the 2nd bike then came along and went through the gap inside the boundary of our house, at this point it was no longer my home. Some other playground, which maybe of my college, my brother&rsquo;s college or my school&rsquo;s playground. Or the amalgamation of three.</p>
<p>Before this scene happened, there was another scene.
I was at my home and we were making different type of new recipes, all are some kind of deep friend thing. It included pork. I tasted pork too (I have never tasted pork in real life) and it tasted like &ldquo;blank&rdquo;. Literally nothing. I guess my mind can&rsquo;t dream new information.
There was another guy (probably brother) I asked him to give one from his plate. He had four. But didn&rsquo;t give any. I said I gave you mine, so why are you saying no? He said nope. I accused him of being selfish and he didn&rsquo;t even show any reaction. Mom was there being a silent audience. I felt like crying but didn&rsquo;t. The ones that we made earlier were inside a box (trunk type).  I sneaked at one time and stole 4 pieces of those deep fried things. Here I have to mention that we were making different dishes. This one that I stole was neither mine nor my brother&rsquo;s. It was different but at least that made me cope with it. I didn&rsquo;t talk with anyone after stealing and went outside where scene 2 happened. It felt better.</p>
