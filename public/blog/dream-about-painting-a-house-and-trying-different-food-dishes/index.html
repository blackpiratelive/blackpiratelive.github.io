<p>I dreamt this on 9th Jan, 2025. I drank coffee that day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I dreamt that I was with mom and we were trying dishes</p>
<p>There was a girl who was ironing some fabric that was supposed to be edible. She burnt some fabric and also in the process her sweater. Her dad took it from her and started doing it. I don&rsquo;t know what it tasted becase we didn&rsquo;t get to taste it.</p>
<p>Then we were painting a house in black, the paint was being done in small black cubes. Light blue was under the black paint. I told mom that we were gonna make a gradient. So after  a while we are going to skip one cubes then two then 3 so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Brother wasn&rsquo;t there, there were other persons. I called him first and he said that his laptop was stolen. But based the descriptuon he gave it was more  broken than stolen. I didn&rsquo;t tell that to mom first. Then Mon called after a while and they talked long about it.</p>
<p>He gave the laptop to repair somewhere but instead of repairing they broke it.</p>
