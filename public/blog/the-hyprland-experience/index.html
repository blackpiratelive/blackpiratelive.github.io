<hr>
<p>I have been using <a href="https://archlinux.orh">Arch Linux</a> with <a href="https://hyprland.org/">Hyprland</a>. Initially I started using because of the cool animation it has. And stayed with it since.</p>
<h2 id="look-and-feel">Look and Feel</h2>
<p>Hyprland excels at it. Animations are super smooth and eyecatchy.I don&rsquo;t necessarily care for eye candy features, but this time made an exception. The default look is actually pretty good. I didn&rsquo;t have to do much ricing to get it look sexy.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuration was not as easy as I expected. I haven&rsquo;t <em>really</em> configured any tiling window manager previously, so it was bit hard for me.  But with few Google search I was easily able to pull it off. I didn&rsquo;t change much. Only changed DPI along with few keybindings.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation for Hyprland is okay. It&rsquo;s not bad, but also nowhere as good as Arch Linux documentation. Basic configuration was easy to understand, but for little bit advanced configuration I was having a tough time. It may be skill issue. I only read the surface level stuff so not totally sure how good the documentation is for more advanced stuff. Being fairly recent window manager, state of the documentation is justifiable.</p>
<h2 id="waybar">Waybar</h2>
<p>This is where I faced my biggest problem. Everything worked as you would expect, but it would not show the numbering of workspaces at first. Documentation for that feature was incomprehensible. Then I skimmed through some dotfiles for hyprland by some people and was able to make it show the workspace number. After that ricing it was easy. I still haven&rsquo;t added any new command. Just the default ones.</p>
<h2 id="wallpaper">Wallpaper</h2>
<p>I used hyprpaper for wallpapers. It is minimal, as you need to change the config to change the wallpaper. I do not like it. Being someone who likes to change wallpaper quite often, I am used to see the wallpaper while applying them. I miss nitrogen. I should write shell script to fix this problem.</p>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<p>Right now I am using foot as my main terminal. I heard it can show images from <a href="https://bugswriter.com">Bugswriter&rsquo;s</a> video, and installed it myself. I configured it to show previews and images in lf file manager. It wasn&rsquo;t easy, but I was able to do it. I am going to stick with this terminal, unless there is a reason to switch.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any problems with wayland. Although I had to relearn a few things. For example I cannot figure out how to change brightness of the monitor of my laptop. Using <code>brill</code> command now I can change brightness. Syntax for it is little bit too much complicated, need to make it into a keybinding. Also why is it that if I lower my brightness too much it would completely shut down the monitor backlight? And then I won&rsquo;t be able to see anything to even revert back.
Audio also gave me some pain which can be attributed to my skill (or the lack thereof), as I installed other DE which came with their own audio configuration, which supposedly messed with my configuration. But right now I have it working smoothly. Also keyboard buttons to change volume working flawlessly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hyprland is the very first window manager that I installed from scratch and configured it myself. Despite of that it was relatively easy to install and configure. Came for the animations, staying for total experience.</p>
