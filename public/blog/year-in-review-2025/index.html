<hr>
<p>So after trying to write for last two years, I think I am going to finish writing this year.
Lets tackle different aspects of my life one by one.</p>
<h2 id="studies">Studies</h2>
<p>I finished my graduation this year on July-August. My college life is finally over, trying to take entry into work life and leave this student life behind. I do not plan on higher studies. Only places that I need higher degrees is in teaching related jobs, and I do not plan on doing those, trying to avoid it.
I started preparing for govt-competitive exams this year seriously. Gave CGL pre for the first time, (mains in scheduled on January next year). MTS didnt happen yet this year. CHSL I wasn&rsquo;t able to give due to distance of exam center. Gave Clarkship Mains at the end of the year.
Am I satisfied with my performance? Um, yes but actually no. I am scared, I think current studying is not adequate to get any good job.
Can I improve it? Yes i can. I want to average around 4-5 hours per day of study in 2026. It is not really ambitious. I am currently studying 3 hours on average (maybe a little less).
What things I want to change in 2026? I want to be just as good in maths like I am in English. I know I can do it. All I need to do is give one mock everyday, WHATEVER HAPPENS, just ONE mock.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>First talk about friendships. I knew I am going to be lonely after I finish college, and it happened, no surprise there. Only a few friends are remaining. Whom I thought would be good friends even after college, no longer much of a friends anymore. And friends whom I didnt care about much and were merely acquaintances, they now talk more often. In hindsight I feel like I should have ended a few friendships but it&rsquo;s harder. This is the first time I am staying in a friendship even if I don&rsquo;t want to. Which friend talks for an hour almost and then say &ldquo;it was nice talking with you&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s irritating.
And about romantic relationship, It&rsquo;s not juicy anymore. Boring. I went to meet my college crush after changing city. Only once we did meet. I am supposed to go by the end of January.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I gained weight last year (It&rsquo;s not a bad thing, it is deliberate). I was skinny, now I am a big guy. Im now hovering around 75-80kgs. I should be mindful about my diet. This year every inch of my body has changed. It&rsquo;s Puberty 2.0. I had to give up almost all my clothes and switch to newer bigger ones. Shirts, T shirts and all my jeans dont fit me anymore. As far as I remember I didnt get sick much this year. If  I have to attribute this to something it would be probably because I tracked my calorie intake for 3 months straight and always fulfilled the daily requirements. It was a good habit but takes too much attention everyday.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>
<p>I travelled some new places this year. The main highlight being Ranchi, Jharkhand. I talked about it <a href="https://blog.blackpiratex.com/ranchi-experience/">here</a>. For CGL mains I went to Kolkata, the usual city. With [redacted] I visited St. Pauls Cathedral and Victoria Memorial. I went there after 10 years. Initially I visited those in class 8th. At the end of the year I spent the night in Durgapur, and also visited Barddhaman.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>I bought a new tablet for studies. My laptop is completely broke now. Phone also broke this year. (display)
I built lot of small and medium apps for my personal use through AI. The main highlight being my <a href="https://diary.sudipx.in">Diary app</a>. I am going to do a prediction and say that AI is here to stay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expecptionally good performance academically. (I have to maintain this and improve on it in 2026) . All the goals I have set for myself was met. Some of it was luck too, I want to thank the universe and God for that.</li>
<li>Did one of the stupidest, courageous and adventurous thing in my life. I am yet to know its result. If it becomes successful, I will have a story to tell.</li>
</ul>
