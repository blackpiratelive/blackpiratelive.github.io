<p>Main character me, brother and another guy. Who is black.</p>
<p>I was cleaning a toilet because it was overflowing. That made vomit reflex and woke me up. Took me at least 3-4 tries to finish cleaning</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another scene where 3 of us were walking at the side of a road/railway. Suddenly a tank came and blocked the whole road. Veichles came fast and crashed into it. 2nd vehicle broke the tank itself. It happened very quickly in less than a minute and we can hear injured people crying.
I was scared because I was worried if some debris would come hitting us and injure us.
We left the scene quickly. It started to rain and we took shelter in a building. This building I have never seen before, it was big, a lot like shopping mall but abandoned. There was lots of people though who were seeking refuge in this rain. I was the first one to reach the building. But even after waiting for a while brother didn&rsquo;t come, so anxiety took over and I went looking for him. I thought he probably lost direction. He was alone. Which was odd, but expected. I asked where the other guy was and he said that there&rsquo;s some people looking for him and want to beat him up, so he went into hiding. I was on top of the balcony and saw two guys looking for someone, one guy had a big stick on his hand. I knew this guy. At first I was scared to make eye contact. But soon realised that they weren&rsquo;t looking for me, so I made eye contact. I even thought of trying to persuade them to stop from hurting that guy. I talked with them, but memories of what happened is fuzzy.</p>
<p>In another scene mom was all alone in this rain at home which made me very sad, it was raining heavily.</p>
<p>In another scene I was in the charge for fixing the plumbing of the house. The plumber came and did the work haphazardly and I had to supervise them to fix it properly. At this time brother was in studying in front of a tuition teacher. The teacher was most probably CC sir.</p>
<p>Oh and there was a map of some place. Which I think I have seen before in another dream but not sure.</p>
