Hey, stranger on the internet. Hope you're doing well. My name is Sudip. This is a website I made to have a place where I would write down weird stuff that comes to my mind. I'm also learning front end web development in my free time. Mostly CSS, and this is the place where I'd experiment with those. I started to learn Javascript recently, it's harder than last two. Also I dont like eye candy stuff much. I want website to be functional and load faster. That is why I've chosen to build static website. I've written/stolen all the codes of this website. Another thing, if this domain doesnt work try https://blackpiratelive.github.io, it should work at any case.

I am a student currently studying. Making website is one of my hobbies. And I love ducks and cats.
